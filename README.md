A batch photo manipulation and organization program in C#

Origin Story: In 2003, we experienced "Tornado Tuesday" in South Dakota. That inspired me to become a storm chaser. Flash forward to my honeymoon where I took a picture of the backside of a supercell complete with mammatus. When I went to print it out, they wanted to charge me $15 to include a copyright in the bottom corner. By this time, I was just starting my journey as a full-time C# developer. I declined and decided I would write my own program to do this. It went through multiple code names, originally starting as Photo Ops, Trebuchet, Pikizzi, and finally landing at photoding. I coded on nights and weekends over a couple years to get it to a decent state - the first was a one dialog program and then morphed into a new UI with a previewer for the watermarking and image manipulation. During my active time as a storm chaser, it would speed up my post-chase report by doing all the manual (and very repetitive) tasks. I tried to sell the program for a time and then smart phones really took off, kind of killing any chance I had at a business.

As I was a very young developer at this time, you'll see the code is pretty rough unfortunately with little/no unit testing. It needs work - architecturally and functionally. It has an underlying engine using serializable XML files to serve as the pattern retainers for photo manipulation and organization.
